# OpenAI API Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and add your actual OpenAI API key
# Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Your API key should start with "sk-" and look like: sk-proj-abc123...
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the .env file with your real key to git
# The .env file is already in .gitignore for security
